**SpecTUS** is a transformer-based tool for reconstructing Gas Chromatography-Electron Ionization (GC-EI) mass spectra. The model reconstructs spectra in a de novo manner — directly translating the spectra into 2D molecular structures represented as SMILES strings. The model is pretrained on a large dataset of synthetic spectra and fine-tuned on a smaller dataset of experimental NIST20 spectra. The NIST20 is a proprietary dataset; therefore, we cannot share the final model, but the code for training the model is carefully documented and available for public use. If you own a license for the NIST20 dataset, you can train the model yourself.

We make freely available the 17.2M synthetic spectra used for pretraining the model and the checkpoint of the pretrained model that
can be further finetuned on your own dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/MS-ML).

## 📝 Abstract
Compound identification and structure annotation from mass spectra are essential in drug detection, forensics, and small molecule discovery. Current approaches to compound identification from electron ionization mass spectra (EI-MS) are dependent on different forms of searching databases that are orders of magnitude smaller than the space of potential molecular structures they attempt to cover. We introduce SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures, a deep learning model for de novo structural annotation, translating gas chromatography EI-MS spectra directly into molecular structures without requiring reference databases. This enables the identification of novel compounds absent from spectral libraries. In a rigorous evaluation, SpecTUS significantly outperformed standard database search techniques. On a held-out test set of 28,267 spectra from NIST 20, the model’s single suggestion perfectly reconstructed 43% of the subset’s compounds. On 76% of this test set, the single suggestion is strictly better, in terms of Tanimoto similarity of Morgan fingerprint, than the result of hybrid database search. With ten suggestions, SpecTUS achieved 65% perfect reconstructions, surpassing hybrid search on 84% of the test set.
